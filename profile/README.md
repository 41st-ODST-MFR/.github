## From Earth, for Earth

Welcome to the official GitHub page of the 41st ODST/MFR, a Halo-themed tactical simulation community for Arma 3. Our mission is to pay homage to the Halo franchise created by Bungie and 343 Studios by creating high-quality operations, campaigns, and modded content that immerse players in the role of an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper (ODST) fighting to defend Earth and Her Colonies against impossible odds.

This organization serves to coordinate the developer operations of our volunteer staff departments, most notably our S-4 "Corps of Engineers" modding team and our S-6 "Electronic Logistics Command" server team. It also serves as a codebase for our open-source repositories, such as our upcoming 41st Social Assets project.

### Fight for Earth. Enlist today!
